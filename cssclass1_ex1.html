            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
                (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is
                to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may
                facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow
                selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without
                fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
                Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the
                transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
                In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and
                used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion,
                medicine and as a source of food.</p>
